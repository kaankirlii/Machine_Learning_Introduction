Clustering:
1) No training phase, "unsupervised learning algorithm"
2) Can predict.  Which cluster new value belongs to?


The algorithms can be grouped like so:
- Algorithms

   1-Supervised Learning

     1a)Classification
     1b)Regression

   2- Unsupervised Learning
     2a) Clustering
